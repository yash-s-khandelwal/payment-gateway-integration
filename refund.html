                <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="privacy-policy">
                <h3>At Adslide, we strive to provide a seamless experience for all attendees of the Fresher's Party. Please review our refund policy carefully before purchasing a ticket, as it outlines the circumstances under which refunds may be issued.</h3>

      <h3>1. Non-Refundable Tickets</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>All ticket purchases are final. Once a ticket has been purchased, it cannot be refunded or canceled under any circumstances, except in the specific scenario outlined in section 2 of this policy.</li>
        <li>Please carefully consider your availability and commitment to attend the event before completing your purchase, as no refunds will be issued for any personal reasons, such as:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Change of plans or inability to attend.</li>
          <li>Conflicting schedules or events.</li>
          <li>Incorrect or incomplete information provided during ticket purchase.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Refunds for Event Cancellation</h3>
      <ul> 
        <li>A refund will only be issued in the event that college administration cancels the Fresher's Party for any reason. This includes situations such as:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Full cancellation of the event.</li>
          <li>Unexpected changes to the event's venue, or schedule that prevent the event from taking place as planned.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>In the case of such a cancellation, ticket holders will be notified promptly, and refunds will be automatically processed to the original payment method used during purchase.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. No Refunds for Postponement</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If the event is postponed or rescheduled to a new date, tickets will not be refunded. Instead, all purchased tickets will remain valid for the new date, and attendees can use their existing tickets to gain entry to the rescheduled event.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Refund Processing Time</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For any eligible refund (i.e., in the event of a cancellation), the payment will be refunded to the original source account. Please allow 3-5 business days for the refund to be processed and for the funds to appear back in your account.</li>
        <li>We are not responsible for delays in processing times that may occur due to factors outside of our control, such as delays with your bank or payment service provider.</li>
      </ul>
   
      <h3>5. Refund Requests</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You do not need to take any action to request a refund if the event is canceled. Refunds will be initiated automatically for all eligible ticket holders.</li>
        <li>If you do not receive your refund within the specified time frame or encounter any issues, please contact us at yashsk23.12@gmail.com / devendrasingh7465@gmail.com for assistance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Processing Fees</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Any fees associated with payment processing are non-refundable. In the event of a cancellation, only the base ticket price will be refunded. Taxes, processing fees, or any other additional charges applied at the time of purchase may not be eligible for reimbursement, depending on payment platform policies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Final Decision</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The decision to issue refunds for any event cancellation is at the sole discretion of college administration and Adslide. No refunds will be granted outside of the circumstances outlined in this policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8. Contact Information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For any inquiries regarding our refund policy, please contact us at yashsk23.12@gmail.com / devendrasingh7465@gmail.com</li>
